                        My name is Scott Lawless. I try to be well rounded but I am somewhat easily defined as
                        an avid gamer a
                        my
                        core. I play games frequently and it is an activity I enjoy as much as any other that
                        I've been
                        fortunate
                        enough to try. My "main game" is League of Legends and I will regularly play 10 or more
                        games per week.
                        I
                        also play many other games a few shooters, a few rts games as well as a grand strategy
                        game in eu4
                        (7000
                        hours played in 8-10 years this game is addicting).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am also heavily interested in e-sports (with the main title I watch being League of
                        Legends again).
                        I also watch counterstrike and dota2 esports(even though I'm rather bad at each) and as
                        well watch
                        quite
                        a few different fighting game scenes(which I'm even worse at). I really find it
                        awe-inspireing and
                        entertaining. It's oft-maligned in popular media but I think they lack the gamer
                        perspective to be able
                        to
                        appreciate what goes in to really big plays or really clever strategies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of gaming I am also a huge dog person. I grew up around many dogs (and some
                        cats) because my
                        mom
                        worked as a puppy-raiser and trainer for a service dog company. I currently Have one
                        dog and he is a
                        black-lab named Levi(pictures coming soon).
