                        My name is Scott Lawless. I try to be well rounded but I am somewhat easily defined as
                        an avid gamer at
                        my
                        core. I play games frequently and it is an activity I enjoy as much as any other that
                        I've been
                        fortunate
                        enough to try. My "main game" is League of Legends and I will regularly play 10 or more
                        games per week.
                        I
                        also play many other games a few shooters, a few rts games as well as a grand strategy
                        game in eu4
                        (7000
                        hours played in 8-10 years this game is addicting).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am a huge animal lover and in particular a dog lover. I currently only have one dog named
                        Levi. He is a black lab and is 3 (almost 4) years old.
                    </p>

                        I have worked in retail of many different varieties and as a web developer in the past. I have
                        been a lifeguard before as well and have even rescued a few victims. It was mostly an
                        uneventful job that was somewhat punishing in the phoenix heat.
